Project description:
A fun and interactive To-Do list app with RPG elements. In a charming pixelated style, this app turns your daily tasks into an adventure. Completing tasks earns you experience points (XP) and levels up your character. Each level unlocks new player icons, making your avatar cooler. This app helps you stay organized while adding a fun twist, making every task feel like an achievement in your RPG journey.

Problem domain:
People often struggle to manage and prioritize their daily tasks effectively, and remembering all tasks without a systematic approach can lead to stress and missed deadlines. Balancing work, personal life, and other responsibilities can be challenging without a clear and organized way to visualize and update tasks as priorities change.

User stories:
As a user I want to be able to a see a list of my pending tasks and completed tasks.
As a user I want to set a timer to have my task done by.
As a user I want to filter my tasks by category.
As a user i want to press a button to mark a task complete.
